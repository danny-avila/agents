 * the per-chunk poll cannot reach.
 *
 * Separate from {@link HOOK_PREEMPT_BOUNDARY_CAPABLE} because the two answer
 * different questions for the user-facing control. An SDK with only the
 * boundary can seal a turn that is already writing an answer, but an interrupt
 * armed while the model is still thinking waits for the whole turn — so a host
 * that probed the wrong flag would promise an interrupt it cannot deliver in
 * exactly the window users reach for it most.
