## Checkpoint

## Goal
What I asked you to do and any sub-goals you identified.

## Constraints & Preferences
Any rules, preferences, or configuration I established.

## Progress
### Done
- What you completed and the outcomes

### In Progress
- What you're currently working on

## Key Decisions
Decisions you made and why.

## Next Steps
Concrete task actions remaining, in priority order.

## Critical Context
Exact identifiers, names, error messages, URLs, and details you need to preserve verbatim.

Rules:
- Record what you did and observed, don't judge or re-evaluate it
- For each tool call: the tool name, key inputs, and the outcome
- Preserve exact identifiers, names, errors, and references verbatim
- Short declarative sentences
- Skip empty sections`;

Don't fact-check or second-guess anything, your tool results are ground truth. If a tool result appears truncated, that's just a display artifact: the tool executed fully. Only the checkpoint, don't respond to me or continue the conversation.

Rules:
- Merge new progress into existing sections, don't duplicate headers
- Compress older completed items into one-line entries
- Move items from "In Progress" to "Done" when you completed them
- Update "Next Steps" to reflect current task priorities.
- For each new tool call: the tool name, key inputs, and the outcome
- Preserve exact identifiers, names, errors, and references verbatim
- Skip empty sections`;
